## Adoption Barriers & Mitigation

### Barrier: Low Current Factoring Adoption ([Only 4% of SMEs use factoring](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/new-relay-cash-flow-compass-uncovers-small-businesses-are-42-overconfident-in-their-cash-flow-control-302222383.html) despite [91% having cash flow issues](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/new-relay-cash-flow-compass-uncovers-small-businesses-are-42-overconfident-in-their-cash-flow-control-302222383.html))

**Reasons:**
- Cost concerns (APRs can reach 30%+)
- Customer relationship fears about third-party collections
- Lack of awareness about factoring as an option
- [72% prefer traditional loans](https://www.fedsmallbusiness.org/reports/survey/2025/2025-report-on-employer-firms) when available
- UCC-1 lien requirements that can block other financing

**Mitigation:**
- Lower fees through reduced fraud risk (0.1-0.5% protocol fee vs [0.55-8.25% industry average](https://www.ibisworld.com/united-states/market-research-reports/invoice-discounting-industry/))
- Privacy-preserving design protects customer relationships
- Educational content targeting the [$5.7T SME financing gap](https://www.smefinanceforum.org/data-sites/msme-finance-gap)

### Barrier: Blockchain/Crypto Complexity

**Mitigation:**
- Abstract away technical complexity in UI
- "No wallet required" onboarding flow (custodial option)
- Educational content focused on business value, not tech

### Barrier: Regulatory Uncertainty

**Mitigation:**
- Work with compliance experts early
- Build KYC/AML integration points
- Target progressive regulatory jurisdictions first
- Engage with regulators proactively

### Barrier: Network Effects (Need Both Sides)

**Mitigation:**
- Launch with committed factor partners
- Subsidize early business users (reduced fees)
- Provide value even with single factor (fraud prevention)

### Barrier: Proving Time UX Issues

**Mitigation:**
- Clear loading indicators and time estimates
- Async transaction submission
- Email/SMS notifications when proofs complete
- Mobile app for on-the-go monitoring
