## Market Opportunity

**Market Size:** Global invoice factoring market reached [€3.89 trillion ($4.2 trillion) in 2024](https://fci.nl/en/news/fci-release-2024-world-industry-statistics-showing-factoring-market-remains-stable), growing at 6-11% CAGR with projected growth to $5.92-8.2 trillion by 2030.

**Industry Pain Point:** [44% of companies reported being affected by invoice fraud in 2024](https://www.fraud.net/glossary/invoice-factoring-fraud), with [over 50% of factoring companies experiencing fraud in the past 12 months](https://magazine.factoring.org/magazine-articles/the-hidden-risks-of-fraud-in-factoring-and-invoice-discounting). Double-factoring fraud has produced catastrophic losses, including the [$2.3 billion First Brands Group case under DOJ investigation in 2025](https://www.funderintel.com/post/the-2-3-billion-vanishing-act-first-brands-and-the-factoring-fraud-that-shocked-wall-street).

**Current Solutions Are Inadequate:**
- **Siloed databases**: Factors don't share data with competitors, enabling double-factoring
- **Centralized registries**: Require trust in central operator, single point of failure
- **Not real-time**: [Median fraud scheme takes 12 months to detect](https://legacy.acfe.com/report-to-the-nations/2024/)
- **Privacy-compromising**: Reveals business relationships to factors and registries
- **Emerging blockchain solutions lack privacy**: [Trade Finance Market's Invoice Check on Ethereum](https://www.gtreview.com/news/asia/invoice-finance-platform-adopts-blockchain-tool-to-stop-fraud-and-double-financing/) prevents double-factoring but exposes invoice data publicly

**Technology Adoption Trends:**

- [20% of global factoring solutions projected to utilize blockchain by 2026](https://www.gminsights.com/industry-analysis/factoring-services-market)
- [62% of businesses cite generative AI as key driver behind surging invoice fraud](https://www.fraud.net/glossary/invoice-factoring-fraud)

## Target Audience

## Pain Points by User Type

### For Businesses Seeking Financing:

- **Privacy exposure**: Current factoring reveals customer relationships to factors
- **Slow approval**: Manual verification takes days
- **High fees**: Fraud risk priced into discount rates ([typical factoring fees range from 0.55% to 8.25%](https://www.ibisworld.com/united-states/market-research-reports/invoice-discounting-industry/), with APRs potentially reaching 30%+)
- **Relationship damage**: Customers learn you're factoring (sign of distress)
- **Cash flow crisis**: [91% of SMEs have cash flow issues](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/new-relay-cash-flow-compass-uncovers-small-businesses-are-42-overconfident-in-their-cash-flow-control-302222383.html), [56% cite paying operating expenses as a challenge](https://www.fedsmallbusiness.org/reports/survey/2025/2025-report-on-employer-firms)
- **Late payments**: [55% of B2B invoiced sales in the US are overdue](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/r/small-business-data/small-business-late-payments-report-2025/), costing [$39,406 per company annually](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/r/small-business-data/small-business-late-payments-report-2025/)

### For Factoring Companies:

- **Fraud epidemic**: [Over 50% of factors experienced fraud in the past 12 months](https://magazine.factoring.org/magazine-articles/the-hidden-risks-of-fraud-in-factoring-and-invoice-discounting), [79-80% of organizations experienced attempted or actual payments fraud in 2023-2024](https://legacy.acfe.com/report-to-the-nations/2024/)
- **Catastrophic losses**: Double-factoring fraud produced [$2.3 billion loss in First Brands case](https://www.funderintel.com/post/the-2-3-billion-vanishing-act-first-brands-and-the-factoring-fraud-that-shocked-wall-street), with fraud accounting for [15-20% of account debtor non-payment cases](https://magazine.factoring.org/magazine-articles/the-hidden-risks-of-fraud-in-factoring-and-invoice-discounting)
- **No way to verify if invoice was already factored elsewhere**
- **Slow detection**: [Median fraud scheme takes 12 months to detect](https://legacy.acfe.com/report-to-the-nations/2024/), [only 22% of organizations recovered 75%+ of funds lost](https://legacy.acfe.com/report-to-the-nations/2024/)
- **Manual debtor verification is expensive**

### For the Ecosystem:

- Lack of preventive mechanisms incentivizes fraudulent behavior
- Higher overall risk profile for the industry
- Market inefficiency due to trust deficits

## Value Proposition

### Core Innovation

**Cryptographic Fraud Prevention:** When an invoice is factored on Aleo, the record is consumed and cannot be double-factored because:
1. Invoice exists as a private record
2. Factoring transaction consumes the record (publishes serial number)
3. Attempting to factor again → serial number already spent → transaction fails

**No central database needed. No trust required. Cryptographically impossible to double-factor.**

### Competitive Advantage

|Aspect|Traditional Factoring|Blockchain (Transparent)|Aleo Confidential|
|---|---|---|---|
|Double-factor prevention|❌ Manual checks, siloed DBs|✅ On-chain registry|✅ Cryptographic|
|Privacy|❌ Factor sees everything|❌ Everyone sees everything|✅ Selective disclosure|
|Speed|Days (manual verification)|Minutes|Minutes|
|Trust requirement|High (central registries)|Medium (public data)|**Zero**|
|Competitive intel leakage|High|Extreme|**None**|
